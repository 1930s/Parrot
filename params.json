It currently features a reverse-engineered API for Google Hangouts, done by [Tom Dryer](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups), with scaffolding around it for multifaceted use. In the future, Facebook Messenger, custom Jabber, WhatsApp, and more protocols may be supported, depending on API availability (or reverse engineering).\r\n\r\n### **[Download](https://github.com/avaidyam/Parrot/releases)**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n# Screenshots\r\n![Parrot Light UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/avaidyam/Parrot/assets/images/ui/Parrot-Light.png \"Parrot Light UI\")\r\n![Parrot Dark UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/avaidyam/Parrot/assets/images/ui/Parrot-Dark.png \"Parrot Dark UI\")\r\n![Parrot Themes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/avaidyam/Parrot/assets/images/ui/Parrot-Theme.png \"Parrot Themes\")\r\n\r\n----------\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\n- Tom Dryer, for reverse-engineering the Hangouts protocol in `hangups`\r\n- Peter Sobot, for the initial translation and development of `Hangover`, a Swift port of `hangups`, which was used as the initial code base for Parrot's Hangouts component.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n# User Issues\r\n- Please see [this link](https://gitreports.com/issue/avaidyam/Parrot) if you're a user of Parrot and don't have a GitHub account.\r\n",
