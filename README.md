# Introduction
Parrot is an extensible instant messaging architecture for OS X. It currently features a reverse-engineered API for Google Hangouts, done by [Tom Dryer](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups), with scaffolding around it for multifaceted use. In the future, Facebook Messenger, custom Jabber, WhatsApp, and more protocols may be supported, depending on API availability (or reverse engineering).
